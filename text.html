            <h2>Introduction and Planning</h2>
            <p>I started off this project by looking for a dataset on kaggle that I found interesting. I love music so I
                searched Spotify and found a dataset that included information such as track name, artist name, various
                song
                attributes such as loudness, explicit, and tempo, as well as key data points such as song popularity,
                total
                listens, and country of origin. Instantly I came up with the idea to create a World Choropleth based on
                the
                example on d3’s site https://observablehq.com/@d3/world-choropleth/2</p>

            <img src="images/map.png" alt="">
            <p>
                I wanted to have it map the explicit and loudness rate of songs from a given country with a color, while
                using some other visual element to also show song popularity. I thought this would be a good way of
                answering the question of how much does the tone of a song (ie. high loudness, and explicit) impact the
                success of a song, and does that differ by country? Sadly after doing some more research on how I would
                actually go about building that graphic and quickly realized that this was beyond the scope of my
                abilities
                as well as not being the best option to answer the question I wanted to answer. In addition to this
                after
                building some test graphics with the dataset I realized it had some large flaws and would need
                significant
                clearing to become usable. For example looking at the top songs I realized I had heard none of them and
                so I
                looked at the monthly stream count and noticed that many of the songs (upwards of 80% of the 82000
                entries)
                had 1-3 extra zeros added to the end of the number. This effectively made the data unusable for my
                purposes
                so I decided to find a new dataset. </p>

            <p>I still wanted to keep the project similar in idea so I searched for a new spotify dataset and ended up
                finding one I deemed perfect.
                https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wardabilal/spotify-global-music-dataset-20092025
                It covered 8582 recent songs from both popular and relatively obscure artists. I took the time to
                preemptively vet the data this time around and confirmed that it had already been cleaned and all
                entries
                made sense for their column. With this new data I had to change the question I was planning to answer as
                I
                no longer had access to any sort of location data for the tracks. I thought about simply making a
                graphic
                comparing explicitness to popularity but ultimately I decided to answer the question “How much does
                artist
                popularity affect an individual song's success?”. I felt this question would be interesting to answer,
                and
                would also allow for the incorporation of different attributes to help answer any questions I may deem
                relevant such as filtering the data by genre or album type.</p>

        <section id="creating-visualization">
            <h2>Creating the Visualization</h2>
            <p>After browsing the d3 sites examples page for inspiration I decided on creating an interactive dot plot
                to
                show the main comparison of artist popularity and track popularity.
            </p>
            <img src="images/dotPlotRefrences.png" alt="">
            <p>
                I planned to loosely base my design around these and planned to add interactivity with the filtering of
                the
                data. I started off by simply loading the data onto my page and getting it into the rough shape of a dot
                plot. This confirmed for me that a dot plot was the correct choice for my visualization as it allows the
                user to quickly see every single song entry and see how it compares.</p>

            <img src="images/firstDraft.png" alt="">

            <p>This helped confirm for me that my question was worth answering as there was a positive correlation
                within
                the data so I decided to keep going from there. My immediate next steps were to adjust the visuals to
                help
                make the data more easily interpreted as well as format it better on the site.</p>

            <img src="images/secondDraft.png" alt="">

            <p>After making some quick changes to the color of the dots, basing them on the type of album the track came
                from (ie. Single, album, soundtrack), as well as formatting the graphic to take up a larger portion of
                the
                screen, I felt that the graphic was coming along nicely. I chose these colors to represent my data types
                because even when viewed in black and white they easily contract against each other instantly allowing
                the
                user to differentiate the two. I chose the size of the site to take up around half of the screen as I
                wanted
                to both ensure it was clearly visible, as well as allowing plenty of room to add features and labels if
                need
                be.</p>

            <p>I was feeling pretty confident with the site and after spending some more time on general polish it was
                looking like this</p>

            <img src="images/finalGraphic.png" alt="">

            <p>The additions I made were all to help increase how easy the data was to interpret for the user. The
                addition
                of a legend allows for one to clearly understand what each color means at a glance. The axes and
                associating
                labels are there to help the user get a better view of the trend within the data, as well as what the
                dots
                even mean. I was content with how the graphic looked visually so I moved on to adding interactability to
                the
                page to help answer more of the leading questions behind the visualization.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="designing-interaction">
            <h2>Designing the interaction</h2>
            <p>The first thing I knew I wanted to add was a way to inspect any given point on the chart. After
                referencing
                the d3 textbook from class I thought the section on tooltips would work perfectly for this idea. I
                created a
                simple tool tip and highlight effect for the dots that would allow the user to hover over any given data
                point and see exactly what song it is as well as the artist and track popularity of that point. I
                initially
                thought about showing it all in a display above the highlighted point but after some testing I realized
                there were some combinations of artists and song titles that ended up being extremely long. So I moved
                the
                words to the bottom of the display and made the numbers of the points bigger and kept them up top. I
                felt
                this compromise allowed for the user to still get all of the information they need from the point while
                also
                keeping the graphic clear of any clutter.</p>

            <img src="images/tooltipTop.png" alt="">
            <img src="images/tooltipBottom.png" alt="">

            <p>Next I wanted a way to look at any given type of album without having to look at them within the context
                of
                the entire visualization. I decided to add an onClick effect to the legend where if you clicked on any
                of
                the different options it would toggle it on the display allowing you to hide and show each of the three
                types.</p>

            <img src="images/soundtracks.png" alt="">

            <p>
                This allows you to get a better answer of how each type affects the overall relationship of the
                datapoint,
                as well as get a better idea of how it compares to the other due to the low opacity nodes shown in the
                background.</p>

            <p>The next main feature I wanted to implement was a way to look at any given artist's songs. I felt this
                was
                something that would be something users would want out of the visualization, as well as helping to see
                exactly how much an artist's popularity affects their success when compared to other artists of similar
                popularity. I decided on both a search bar and allowing the user to click on the graphic itself to sort
                by
                the selected artist.</p>

            <img src="images/theWeeknd.png" alt="">

            <p>This works similar to the type filtering by making all unrelated nodes low opacity while keeping the
                selected
                artist’s points fully visible. I felt this effectively allowed for the user to look at any artist to see
                where their songs tend to end up in comparison to their own popularity.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="conclusion-takeaways">
            <h2>Conclusion and Takeaways</h2>
            <p>I designed this visualization to answer the question of how artist popularity impacts popularity and it
                clearly answered that.</p>

            <img src="images/finalGraphic.png" alt="">

            <p>There is a clear positive relationship between the two variables. This led me to asking more questions
                such
                as how it differs by album type, and if the relationship changes for different artists. The interactive
                features I included allowed me to answer these new questions.</p>
            <img src="images/singles.png" alt="" height="300">
            <img src="images/albums.png" alt="" height="300">
            <img src="images/soundtracks.png" alt="" height="300">

            <p>Looking at the three different graphics you can make some takeaways. Albums seem to more closely stick to
                the
                artist popularity trend whereas singles seem to have a higher chance of underperforming in comparison to
                the
                artist. This makes complete sense as singles are often where artists chose to experiment with new sounds
                that their fans may not necessarily enjoy. When looking at soundtracks the points seem to be spread out
                relatively randomly while still following the general positive trend. This is likely due to external
                factors
                such as movie success and social media trends.</p>

            <p>When looking at how different artists compare to each other you can make some clear takeaways when
                comparing
                breakout artists to long established ones. Here we are looking at Nirvana's data on the left and a
                recent
                girl group that has blown up called Katseye on the right.
                When comparing the two you can clearly see that although Nirvana is a more popular artist there none of
                their songs other than the most popular track reach the popularity of Katseye’s least popular release.
                This
                confirms that although artists popularity does generally lead to song success there is more that goes
                into
                it that this data cannot show.</p>

            <p>Overall I am quite happy with how my visualization came out and I feel that it does a great job at
                answering
                the question I designed it to help solve. If I were to continue to work on it into the future I would
                like
                to gather data myself from the spotify api to include things like track release, as well as monthly
                changes
                in popularity to allow me to get a deeper understanding of how these two variables affect each other.
